     Takes a file path where the data matrix is storedXX.
    
    It is inmportant that assigned_instances is sorted in ascending order as in this way the indexes will match the 
    column ids of the matrix retrieved by get_slice_from_input_file.
    
     Returns a core-point sample (col ids of the original matrix as denoted by assigned_instances).
     This sample is built from the core-points detected by the SNN algorithm ran within the node.
